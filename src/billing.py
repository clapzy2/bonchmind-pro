"""Billing context resolution (Stage 12).

The single seam every quota / limit decision goes through, so the code never
reads a plan field directly. Today the billing subject is the workspace owner
(personal ``User.plan``); when organizations land, this resolver gains one
branch (``workspace.organization`` → ``org`` plan) and nothing downstream
changes. See ``design/monetization-and-b2b.md``.
